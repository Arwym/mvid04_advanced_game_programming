# AG_08_03

In this activity, we created a scene with multiple cubes, applying a spot light caster and adjusting the fragment shader, taking AG_08_02 as the base for the project.

**Introduced/reviewed in this activity**: difference between a simple light as seen before, and a spot light that lights up a surrounding area in the scene in a cone-like form.

Progress tracked in issue #31.
