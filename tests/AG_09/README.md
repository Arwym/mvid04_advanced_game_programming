# AG_09

In this activity, we wanted to import a 3D model into a scene, by using the Assimp library. To abstract all the model loading functionality, we created a Mesh class and a Model class and updated our project's code to make use of them. The base project was AG_08_05.

**Introduced/reviewed in this activity**: how the Assimp library takes care of loading models, how models work in the real world, by being composed of many meshes and textures.

Progress tracked in issue #32.
