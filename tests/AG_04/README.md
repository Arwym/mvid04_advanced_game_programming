# AG_04
The goal was learn to apply textures to geometry, by adding texture coordinates as vertex attributes, using the STB image library to load the texture images, binding them to the program, and applying them in the fragment shader. Mixing two textures with the mix function.  

**Introduced in this activity**: Review of vertex attributes, strides, vertex shaders and fragment shaders, use of uniforms. Introduced to interpolation with textures, texture coordinates, pexels, texture sampling and filtering, mixing textures.

Progress tracked in issue #22.
