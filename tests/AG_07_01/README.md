# AG_07_01
The objective was to learn how to create materials, providing different Phong component values for light and material and combining them in the fragment shader, to recreate the same scene as AG_06.

**Introduced/reviewed in this activity**:  review of Phong lighting model --ambient, diffuse, specular, shininess.

Progress tracked in issue #30.
