Create a camera class with keyboard and mouse controls, and incorporate it in a project with FPS-like controls: mouse movement, mouse scroll and WASD keyboard to move and rotate the view, allowing the player to move around the world.

**Introduced/reviewed in this activity**: Camera positioning, constructing a lookAt matrix; Euler angles (pitch, yaw and roll);handling mouse and keyboard input and applying them to camera movement.

Progress tracked in issue #24.
