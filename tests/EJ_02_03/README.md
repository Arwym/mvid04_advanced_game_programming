# EJ_02_03
The goal was to paint the same triangles from EJ_02_01 and EJ_02_02, but the same VAO, VBO ans EBO for both of them.

**Reviewed in this exercise**: (1) indexed drawing, using EBOs and calling glDrawElements instead of glDrawArrays (2) remembering that the order in which vertex indices are set is important.

Progress tracked in issue #8.
