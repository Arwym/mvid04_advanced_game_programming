# AG_05_01
The goals: learn how to perform transformations (Translate-Rotate-Scale order) and understand Model-View-Projection. Apply the same view and projection to different models, re-use the same geometry (vertices) in multiple models. Correct issues with cull facing and depth tests.

**Introduced/reviewed in this activity**: Review of the OpenGL pipeline, coordinate systems, and vector and matrix operations, as well as transformations. Introduction to Model-View-Projection and depth buffers.

Progress tracked in issue #24.
