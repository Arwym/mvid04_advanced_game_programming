# AG_06
This activity serves as an introduction to lighting, using the Phong (Ambient + Diffuse + Specular) model. Two cubes were created and put together in the scene, one serving as a global, directional light, and the other was a light receptor/reflector.

**Introduced/reviewed in this activity**:  We learned about normals, and how to make the calculations required for this simple but very accurate lighting model, Phong. We also learned what ambient, diffuse and specular means, and looked at the difference between flat, gouraud and phong lighting.

Progress tracked in issue #29.
