# AG_08_04

In this activity, we follow up on the spot light caster (AG_08_03), adding soft edges by indicating a cut-off angle and adjusting the calculations in the fragment shader.

**Introduced/reviewed in this activity**: how to add soft edges around the spot light, giving two cut-off angles, calculating theta, epsilon and intensity, and incorporating intensity to the Phong calculation.

Progress tracked in issue #31.
