# EJ_02_06
Draw a hexagon at the center of the screen, but programatically, using polar coordinates.

**Reviewed in this exercise**: explore other drawing modes

**Notes**: I had a lot of difficulty calculating the indices procedurally, so instead of drawing with element buffer object and GL_TRIANGLES, I did it with no EBO and GL_TRIANGLE_FAN instead, 7 unique vertices in total.

Progress tracked in issue #11.
